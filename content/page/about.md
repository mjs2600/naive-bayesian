I live in Middlebury, Vermont with my wife, [Mary Jane](http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/chem/faculty/node/539926), and two small children.
I am the chief data scientist at [Snthesis](https://snthesis.com/) and a graduate from Georgia Tech's [OMSCS program](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/).
I also love to hike and play the ukulele.
